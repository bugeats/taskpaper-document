# taskpaper-document

A robust [Taskpaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) parser, builder, and serializer with no external dependencies.

Written in pure ES5.  Works in node > `0.10.x` and as a browser bundle.

A project design goal is to always have input perfectly match serialized output, even for fuzzy or non-Taskpaper documents.
